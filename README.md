`wait` is a really small Docker utility that blocks until another container is accepting TCP connections.

The default operation looks for a single exported port. Use it like this:

    $ docker run -d --name mycontainer some-image-or-other
    $ docker run --link mycontainer:mycontainer n3llyb0y/wait
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:5432......ok

note: it doesn't matter what the link alias is.

If the container you are linking to has multiple port exports then you will need
to let `wait` know which ones you are interested in. To do so, set the PORTS environment
variable at run:

    $ docker run -d --name mycontainer some-image-or-other
    $ docker run -e PORTS=80,443 --link mycontainer:mycontainer n3llyb0y/wait
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:80......ok
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:443......ok

`wait` will also interrogate linked services that share the same port (as within a cluster, for example)

    $ docker run -d -p 9200 --name cluster1 some-image-or-other
    $ docker run -d -p 9200 --name cluster2 some-image-or-other
    $ docker run -e PORTS=9200 --link cluster1:w1 --link cluster2:w2 n3llyb0y/wait
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:9200......ok
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.106:9200......ok

By default each connection attempt will bail after 30 seconds. You can specify an override using the TIMEOUT env variable:

    $ docker run -d -p 9200 -p 32000 --name myservice some-image-or-other
    $ docker run -e PORTS="9200 32000" -e TIMEOUT=10 --link myservice:w1 n3llyb0y/wait
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:9200...ok
    waiting for TCP connection to 172.17.0.105:32000............WARN: unable to connect

**experimental usage in docker-compose.yml**

I've used this utility in docker-compose yaml files in order to orchestrate a wait period when running automated tests. I don't know how it will behave in other situations!

example docker-compose.yml:

    db:
      image: postgres
      ports:
        - "5432"
    es:
      image: dockerfile/elasticsearch
      ports:
        - "9200"
    wait:
      image: n3llyb0y/wait
      environment:
        PORTS: "5432 9200"
      links:
        - es
        - db

Here the `wait` container explicitly links to the db and es containers and passes on the ports required to wait for.

Rather than using `docker-compose up`, instead use

    docker-compose run wait

This launches the linked services and backgrounds them, then returns control after the wait container finishes. It looks like this might need to be tweaked for future versions of docker-compose but as of version `1.1.0` it does just what I need.

**TODO**
The echo output seems to drop the initial `waiting for...` for subsequent hosts. This needs a workaround or better explanation of why that happens and a proper fix.
